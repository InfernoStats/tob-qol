# Theatre of Blood: Quality of Life
Features that have been desired to be included that **do** follow the guidelines of the 3rd Party Clients, at the time of submission.

If you experience any issues or have any concerns, please reach out to Damen via a GitHub Issue or by Discord Messaging directly (Damen#9999) OR via the Runelite Discord by mentioning @Damen.

**Feature List:**
- General:
    - Bank-all Menu Entry Swapper for the Loot Chest
    - Supply Chest Menu Entry Swapper to Buy-1, Buy-x, or Buy-all
    - Light Up Ver Sinhaza to remove the darkness inside Ver Sinhaza
    - Loot Reminder to display a message at the entrance and outline the chest when loot remains in the chest

- The Maiden of Sugadinti:
    - Display Crabs Health in either a current hitpoints value or health percentage (similar to CoX Vanguards)
    - Show Leaks in the chatbox to indicate which crab was leaked and at what health percentage

- Pestilent Bloat:
    - Null Bloat Tank Tiles removes the top piece of the bloat tank so that when you attempt to click through the tank at "weird" angles, it will not cause your character to path unintentionally - the entire tank still remains visible.
    - Hide Ceiling Chains removes the room scenery for Ceiling Chains and surrounding static hands

- Nylocas:
    - Pillar HP displays the current health percentage of the pillars (similar to CoX Vanguards)
    - Hide Pillars will remove the pillars within the area
    - Recolor Menu will recolor the menu depending on the type of NPC it is to further clarify the names
    - Recolor Bigs Menu Darker will recolor the menu to be the darker variant of what's utilized above (Dependent on Above being true)
    - Role Selector will provide an overlay that you can utilize to select your role and mark the tiles of the NPCs your role pertains to
    - Bigs SW Tile will display the Southwest tile of the NPCs related to the role you have selected (Dependent on Above being ON)
    - Instance Timer will display a tick counter above your local player to identify when to enter the room to avoid an initial wave spawn delay

- Sotetseg:
  - Instance Timer will display a tick counter above your local player to identify when to step off of the Maze or leave the portal for Sotetseg to be clickable again
  - Projectile Themes will allow you to modify the projectiles that are spawned to assist players who are color blind, seeing as Sotetseg's current mage and range projectile are not colorblind-accommodating. [Current Theme(s): Inferno] Certain themes will have specific configuration options to enable or disable certain features of that theme (e.g. Zuk Ball for Sotetseg's Death Ball)
  - Hide White Screen will remove the white flash when being teleported for the maze due to being an eyesore (similar to Smoke Devil overlay removal). This does not provide any benefit to the maze seeing as no-one is able to (legally) see the Sotetseg to rush the maze.

- Xarpus:
  - Instance Timer will display a tick counter above your local player to identify when to enter the room to not delay the spawn of the room's first exhumed
  - Mark Exhumeds will take care of the tedious marking of individual object markers, which is achievable in the base RL plugin
  - Mute Xarpus HM Entry will mute the startling sound of all the poison splats being shot by Xarpus on the same tick
  - Xarpus Sheesh Screech replaces the standard "Screech" sound from Xarpus with the popular "Sheesh" sound clip

- Verzik Vitur:
  - Verzik Reds Health Overlay will display the health of the P2 Reds (similar to Maiden and CoX Vanguards)
  - Mark Yellows will mark the tile occupied to fill tile to easily identify it's location while also providing the option to recolor those who may not be able to see the color yellow
  - Mark Tornadoes will simply mark the tornado NPCs and provide a "trailing" tile (this will mark all tornadoes, **NOT** specific to the one targeting you)
  - Mute Verzik Sounds will mute the annoying sounds of Verzik such as the P3 Foot Steps
